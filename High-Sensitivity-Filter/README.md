# High Sensitivity Filter

See the README file in the root of the Sentinel-Scalable-NLP GitHub.

* The following graphics illustrate how patients with a phenotype of interest (left) may be identified with reasonable sensitivity and specificity by a simple rule (middle) and how the set identified by the simple rule may be augmented to improve sensitivity for true cases at moderate expense in terms of increased sample size.
