# High Sensitivity Filter

Improve identification of patients with a phenotype of interest (A):

* (B)...over and above traditional filtering approaches that identify presumptive cases using small sets of disease-specific diagnosis codes that are reasonably specific but overlook some true cases 
* (C)...via a data-driven approach for discovering other coded data that may serve as surrogates to traditional filters
* ...thereby improving overall sensitivity at reasonable cost in specificity, illustrated using a COVID-19 phenotype.
